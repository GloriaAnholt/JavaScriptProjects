                <li class="remove" id="exp_blackmorel"><h3>Black Morel</h3><p>The cap up to 8cm wide, hollow inside with
                    characteristic honeycomb surface consisting of black/brown ridges and dark brown pits, darkening
                    with age. Stem is white, smooth, irregular and hollow. Bottom of cap does not hang loose but is
                    joined to the stem. Grows single or numerous on the ground, usually near conifers. Appears in early
                    spring. Mild pleasant taste and odor; cook before eating. Tip: morels are variable shape, size and
                    color (white/gray/yellow/brown/black), but are characterized by their distinctively shaped caps that
                    do not hang loose and their hollowness; all morels are prized edibles. Warning: may be poisonous if
                    consumed with alcohol. Warning: do not confuse with a False morel, which is not hollow inside and
                    has a cap attached at the top of the stalk rather than a continuous hollow chamber.</p></li>

                    Plenty or Black Trumpet. The cap is up to 8cm wide, with a hollow tube-like depresson, dark brown or
                    soot-grey/black. In older specimens the cap margins are wavy/split, otherwise they are rolled out.
                    Fruiting body is funnel-shaped with smooth-looking but slightly wrinkled outer surface that is
                    smokey grey with a lilac tint, and extends almost to the base. Stem is very short, hollow, brown.
                    Grows on the ground grouped together under conifer/hardwood stands. Appears in the early summer and
                    fall. Has a mild/pleasant taste and odor; cook before eating. An edible look-alike is Craterellus
                    fallax, which is practically identical but has an orange spore print rather than whitish.</p></li>

                    of the mushroom is pale violet with small ridges running down almost to the base. Flesh is thick,
                    soft, blue to black. Stems are fused together. Appears in sumer and fall. Grows in large, dense
                    clusters under conifers such as spruce and fir. Taste is mild and pleasant, with an indistinct odor;
                    cook before eating.</p></li>

                    wide, white or yellow/brown tinted, shaped like a cauliflower head with a spongy, curly rosette
                    exterior. Has no visible stem, gills, tubes, pores or spines. Flesh is white, firm, with many
                    branches arising from a hidden central stalk. Appears in the late summer and fall. Grows singly or
                    in small groups on the ground at or near the base of conifers. Has a mild, pleasant taste and
                    indistinct odor; cook thoroughly before eating, younger specimens are preferred. An edible look-alike
                    is Sparassis spathulata, which is similar in appearance but has multiple anchor points to the ground.</p></li>

                    depressed in the center, smooth, dry, uniform egg-yolk yellow. Mature specimen is funnel shaped,
                    immature specimens should be avoided. Forking ridges (rib-like folds) are present rather than gills;
                    they descend onto the stem. Flesh is firm, yellowish, does does not change color when bruised. Stem
                    is solid, orange tinted, tapering slightly to the base. Grows solitary or in groups on the ground,
                    but not clustered at base of trees, and never on wood. Appears in the summer and fall. Has a pleasant,
                    mild taste and mild, fruity odor; cook before eating. An edible look-alike is the Smooth chanterelle
                    (Cantharallus lateritis), which is similar in appearance but grows under oaks, has a pinkish hue and
                    reduced ridges. Warning: do not confuse with the poisonous False Chantarelle (Hygrophoropsis
                    aurantiaca), has gills rather than ridges, often grown on decaying wood, tastes foul and causes
                    stomach upset. Warning: do not confuse with the poisonous Jack-O'Lantern Fungus (Omphalotus illudens),
                    which grows in large clusters on roots, stumps, or at the base of trees and has an unpleasantly
                    sweet odor.</p></li>

                <li class="remove" id="exp_chickenofthewoods"><h3>Chicken of the Woods</h3><p>The fruiting bodies are up
                    to 20cm wide, shelf-like, rubbery, sulphur yellow to orange, sometimes with bright orange tips.
                    Older specimens become pale and brittle, chalk-like. Flesh is white to yellow tinted, firm, softer
                    towards the edges. Underside is characteristically white to bright yellow, with tiny pores instead
                    of gills. Has no stem. Grows in overlapping groups on logs, stumps, or wounds of trees. Appears in
                    spring, summer, and fall. Has a mild taste and odor; cook before eating. Tip: harvest the soft outer
                    margin of the younger specimens to avoid bitterness. An inedible (but not poisonous) look-alike is
                    Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, which is corky/rigid rather than rubbery, and orange/red on the top and
                    underside, rather than bright yellow on the underside. an inedible (but not poisonous) look-alike is
                    Hapalopilus nidulans, which is cinnamon brown/orange on the top and the underside, rather than b
                    right yellow on the underside. Warning: can cause allergic reaction in some people due to toxins
                    absorbed from the tree; begin by sampling small amounts.</p></li>

                    wide, pear-shaped, white to dull white, with small conical spines that break off but leave a network
                    of spots behind. Flesh must be firm and all-white. Flesh must be undifferentiated with no trace of
                    gills, no thick rind and no outline of mushroom visible in cross section. appears in the summer and
                    fall. Has a mild taste with no odor; cook before eating. A non-poisonous look-alike is Lycoperdon
                    foetidum, which is similar in appearance but are brown/greyish-beige rather than white and has an
                    unpleasant odor. Grows singly, in groups or clumped together on forest beds under conifers and
                    hardwoods. A look-alike with unknown edibility is Lycoperdon umbrinum, which is similar in appearance
                    but are brown/tan rather than white. Warning: do not confuse with young specimens of the deadly
                    Destroying Angel or other poisonous white mushrooms, which have no spines and have faint
                    differentiation inside rather than being solid white.</p></li>

                    smooth, dry, wavy at the edges, light brown with an orange tint. Underside has distinctive spines
                    that are cream-colored. Flesh is white when cut, coloring unevenly to yellow-brown. Stem is solid,
                    white, possibly enlarging slightly towards the base. Grows solitary or numerous on the ground in
                    areas with conifers and hardwoods. Appears in the summer and fall. Has a pleasant taste with no odor;
                    cook before eating. An edible look-alike is Hydnum umbilicatum, which is similar in appearance but
                    smaller and with a darker cap, growing in bogs and swamps. An inedible (but not poisonous) look-alike
                    is Bankera fuligineo-alba, which is similar in appearance but instead of a smooth cap has one with
                    embedded pine needles and organic debris.</p></li>

                <li class="remove" id="exp_kingbolete"><h3>King Bolete</h3><p>Cap is up to 35cm wide, convex, reddish to
                    yellowish brown, smooth but often uneven. Underside of cap consists of pores, off-white to olive in
                    age, with no pink tinge.  Flesh is white; flesh and pores unchanging when bruised. Stem is white or
                    tinted yellow/brown with a characteristic fine, white network extending down from the top of the
                    stem, variable in shape. Partial veil absent. Grows singly or as many in conifer and hardwood stands.
                    Appears in spring, summer and fall. Has a mild and pleasant taste with no odor; cook before eating.
                    Tip: boletes are mushrooms that grow on the ground and have a sponge-like surface on the underside
                    of the cap - tiny pores, rather than gills. There are no deadly-poisonous boletes, though some
                    varieties can cause nausea/vomiting. An unknown bolete is safe if it does not bruise blue after
                    being cut, is not red on the underside of the cap, and does not taste foul. Small amounts should be
                    consumed when testing an unfamiliar bolete.</p></li>

                    shape, smooth, moist, cream to light brown. Flesh is off-white, firm. Stem usually not present,
                    otherwise white, dry, with white hairs at base. Usually grows in large overlapping custers, on trees,
                    logs and stumps of hardwoods and conifers, never on the ground. Appears in spring and fall. Has a
                    mild, pleasant taste and fragrant fruity odor; cook before eating. Tip: the oyster mushroom has
                    several look-alikes that are indistinguishable in the field, all are edible as long as they grow on
                    trees (avoid those growing on dead wood/logs/stumps). A potentially poisonous look-alike is the
                    Angel wings mushroom (Pleurocybella porrigens), which is similar in appearance but is white rather
                    than cream, has thinner flesh, no odor, and grows on dead wood (logs/stumps) rather than trees.</p></li>

                    cylidrical, white, and covered in thin, shaggy red/brown scales. Older specimens have a cap that is
                    bell-shaped. Flesh is white, soft. Gills are narrowly attached to the stem and white/grey when young.
                    The flesh and gills of older specimens liquefies into a black inky mass. Partial veil leaves an
                    inferior, possibly moveable ring on the white stem. Shaggy manes grows scattered or grouped together
                    in grassy areas covering decomposing wood. They appear in the early spring and late fall. Has a
                    pleasant taste with no odor; cook before eating. An edible look-alike is Coprinus sterquilinus,
                    which similar in appearance but smaller, with fewer scales and growing on dung. Tip: collect younger
                    specimens and/or remove blackening areas which have a more bitter taste. Tip: cooking with water
                    shortly after collecting helps to prevent the dish from turning into a black inky mess.</p></li>
